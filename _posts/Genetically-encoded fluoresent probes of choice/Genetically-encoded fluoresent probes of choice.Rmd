In truth this post is a reference to a USCD Nikon imaging centre webpage, which has a great guide to selecting fluorophores:

https://nic.ucsd.edu/tips/fps.html  


I second the advice to use FP-base to keep on track of the latest fluorophores, especially using thier interactive charts. https://www.fpbase.org/chart/  

My list differs slightly from the USDN NIC list, solely with the release od msGFP2 (though I have not tried it personally it looks promising): 


- 405 nm : mTagBFP2
- 445 nm : mTurquoise2
- 488 nm : mEmerald/msGFP2/mNeonGreen 
- 515 nm : mVenus
- 561 nm : mScarlet-I
- 640 nm : miRFP670  


For SMLM experiments:  


- mPA-GFP 
- mEos4a
