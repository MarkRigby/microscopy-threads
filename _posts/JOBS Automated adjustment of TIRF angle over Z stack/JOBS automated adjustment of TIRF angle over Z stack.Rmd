title: "JOBS: Automatic adjustment of TIRF angle over Z-stack"
categories:
  - NIS-Elements

description: |
  A method for moving the angle of the TIRF illuminator as the Z-stack transitions from top to bottom.  TIRF angles are set by the user at the top and bottom of the z-stack before acquisition, and the JOB lineraly interpoloates the TIRF angle for each z step.
