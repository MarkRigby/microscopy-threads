title: "Another microscopy blog with some NIS-Elements tips"
description: |
  Posts will tend to be on recent advances in light microscopy, with monthly twitter and paper round-ups. In addition there will be some posts that I hope can be of us to microscopists using NIS-Elements to acquire or analyse their images.

## About me
I'm an advanced imaging specialist for Nikon UK, predominantly advising scientists on what microscopes to use, how to use them effectively, and how best to analyse their images. I'm mostly based around London, but sometimes go further afield.  


Previously, I had been working as a post doc in  Prof. Juan Burrone's lab at Kings College London studying the action potential in neuronal axons using the latest genetically-encoded voltage indicators. Before that I worked as an electrophysiologist at Doshisha University, Japan, with Prof. Tomoyuki Takahashi, and before that I was at UCL where I did my PhD with Prof. Mark Farrant.
